intra-individual-WIT-MS
=======================

Intra-individual analysis of racial bias on the Weapon Identification Task (WIT; Payne et al., 2002) across two independent samples (N=150 and N=148). Will demonstrate different kinds of benefits of the intra-individual approach -- over the standard between-person approach. Will review current theoretical models of racial bias and elaborate on the implications our results have for such theoretical models. Meta-theoretical issues related to theory testing in social psychology will also be discussed.
